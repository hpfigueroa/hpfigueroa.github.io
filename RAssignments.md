### R Assignments for data analytics

##### [Understanding a Building Utility bill](/RAssignments/ReadmeUB.html)  
This preliminary analysis enable us to identify how we can reduce electricity expenses for buildings and commercial customers.
We can analyze annual charges by using demand time series datasets.

##### Battery Investment Optimization  
1. [Introduction to Optimization in R](/RAssignments/lpSolveAPI.html)  
This tutorial will introduce you to linear programming optmization capabilities in R using the lpSolveAPI library.

2. [Battery Optimization](/RAssignments/BatteryOptimization.html)  
Battery charging and discharging characteristics can be optimized to minimize electricity expenses. 
The utility energy market is shifting from uniform pricing throughout the day to time-of-use (TOU) pricing. 
Variable electricity pricing provides opportunities for batteries to profit by charging and storing energy when prices are low and discharging and supplying energy when prices are high.
By using time series datasets for consumer demand and electricity prices in conjunction with domain knowledge about battery behavior, we can optimize the benefits of battery investments.

##### [Wind Energy Forecasting](/RAssignments/WindForecasting.html)
Forecasting is widely used in electricity markets. Forecasting changes in electricity demand and generation is performed in real-time by utility operators.
Operation of wind turbine power plants, requires forecasting of wind generation, which can be performed using multiple techniques resulting in different accuracy levels.
Using wind measurement time series, we can use [ARIMA](http://otexts.org/fpp2/arima.html) to forecast the future next hour of wind resources.

##### [Wind Energy Assessment](/RAssignments/Wind_Energy_Assessment.html)  
Deciding whether to build another generation plant, e.g. a wind turbine farm, requires an assessment of wind energy generation.
Analyzing the probability density function of wind measurements provides a reliable and quick estimation of the potential energy production of an wind energy site.
Using wind measurement time series datasets, we can estimate the potential for energy production.
